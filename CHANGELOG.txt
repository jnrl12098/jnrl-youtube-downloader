YT-DL-GUI Version 0.11
* implemented label that shows "Loading..." while details and options are still loading
* handled exception related to HTTP Error 404 
YT-DL-GUI Version 0.10
* implemented string slicing on the video title if it's too long
	* string[0:END:-1] doesn't work; string[0:END][::-1] does (to get the index of whitespace within the char_per_line limit)
* implemented exception handling for filenames that are invalid or already taken by an existing file
	* when implementing download queue in the future, must also check if filename was already taken by an item in the queue
* implemented feature where if the user cancels the download, the incomplete download file is deleted
* moved the filename check above the configuration of buttons to avoid having to reset the buttons if the filename was already taken

YT-DL-GUI Version 0.09
* the search button now starts a thread of search_stream, just like how the download button starts a thread of download_stream
* removed the use of StringVar for some widgets; went with directly changing the ["text"] of widgets instead to use less variables
* for now, placed all features of functions related to search_stream such as display_image and display_stream into the search_stream functions
	* this is to avoid errors related to one thread loading before the other but lacking required information because the other function hasn't finished yet
* wrapped yt.length in float() for gmtime() to help avoid the error "int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a real number, not 'NoneType'"
	* root of problem is sometimes yt.length is not retrieved at all
* handled specific exceptions encountered when retrieving details such as youtube title, views, length

YT-DL-GUI Version 0.08
* implemented pause/resume (toggle) and cancel download features
	* subject to change when download queue is implemented, but for now, the download button is disabled while downloading is in progress or paused
* added a label that will display the download progress in text (bytes downloaded vs filesize)
* the user will be warned if the download button was clicked but no stream was selected, and the download will not start
* organized widgets into frames; main_window will consist only of frames that are packed while frames consist of widgets that are arranged in a grid
* implemented a feature where the frames of widgets disappear when the url is invalid, along with an error message
YT-DL-GUI Version 0.07
* user can now enter their preferred file name for the download file
* switched from stream.download() to manually writing from the iterable stream
	* this was necessary to introduce pause/resume and cancel features
	* this makes the on_progress and on_complete functions unnecessary, but will keep them for now to use as reference

20230416
YT-DL-GUI Version 0.06
* decided to change from camelCase to snake_case for consistency with tests of components
* uploaded tests of components to go back to in the future

20230415
YT-DL-GUI Version 0.06
* removed feature to specify video resolution and input stream identification tag (itag)
* replaced the above feature with a feature that shows user the list of available streams, 
  and user can download a stream by choosing from the list of options then clicking the download button
	* itag of each stream is contained in a global variable: list[int] and these are IDEALLY sorted in the same order as the streams in the listbox
* rearranged widgets to show in the following order:
	* enter youtube video URL
	* show youtube video details
	* download details
	* list of stream options

20230414
YT-DL-GUI Version 0.05
* thumbnail is now placed in a frame which also includes other details such as:
	* title, length (H:M:S), channel name, view count (in youtube format), date published (not accurate with date shown in page though)
	* could not compute video age (i.e. published xx ago) because publish date is off by a few days and lacks hours-minutes-seconds
YT-DL-GUI Version 0.04
* implemented a feature which shows the thumbnail of the video that was searched
	* the function for displaying the thumbnail is placed in a separate non-daemon thread
	* thumbnail is resized from 640x480 to 240x180
* implemented a "Show Threads" button for debugging purposes; to show the number of active threads at any time

20230412
YT-DL-GUI Version 0.03
* download function was given its own thread to prevent the Tk window from not responding while the download is going on
* the thread was set to be a daemon thread to allow the download to be interrupted/cancelled by closing the Tk window

20230411
YT-DL-GUI Version 0.02
* added a progress bar to show the progress of the download
* a messagebox will pop up to inform the user that the download has been finished

  and will return to normal when the download function is finished
YT-DL-GUI Version 0.01
* bare minimum to download a video: 
	* search for a video using URL, filter by resolution is optional
